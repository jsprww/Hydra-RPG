18th August, 1308

The sky is red today, eerie from the glow of the Moon of Fire. People have been taken. The
reports say the they have appeared, but in the form of a log. This morning my son got taken
people have said they saw him get dragged into Castle Log. Which does explain why everyone
turning into logs.
